## Day 1: Docker Refresh + K8s Fundamentals ✅
**Date:** Completed
**Hours Studied:** 8/8

### Checklist
- [x] Docker basics refreshed
- [x] Understood container vs orchestration
- [x] Learned K8s architecture (control plane, worker nodes)
- [x] Installed minikube
- [x] Deployed first pod
- [x] Used kubectl: get, describe, logs, exec

### Key Learnings
```
1. K8s solves multi-host orchestration, auto-scaling, self-healing
2. Control Plane (API Server, etcd, Scheduler) vs Worker Nodes (kubelet, kube-proxy)
3. Pods are smallest deployable unit, Deployments manage pods
```

### Questions to Review
```
1. What's the difference between Docker and Kubernetes?
2. What component decides which node a pod runs on? (Scheduler)
```

### Confidence Level: ✅✅✅✅⬜ (4/5)

## Day 2: Kubernetes Core Concepts ✅
**Date:** Completed
**Hours Studied:** 8/8

### Checklist
- [x] Pods deep dive complete
- [x] Created Deployment
- [x] Scaled a deployment
- [x] Exposed service (ClusterIP, NodePort)
- [x] Worked with namespaces
- [x] Understand labels and selectors

### Key Learnings
```
1. Services provide stable endpoints (ClusterIP internal, NodePort external, LoadBalancer cloud)
2. Labels + Selectors connect Services to Pods
3. Deployments handle rolling updates with zero downtime
```

### Questions to Review
```
1. Why use Service instead of Pod IP directly? (Pods ephemeral, Services stable)
2. RollingUpdate vs Recreate deployment strategy
```

### Confidence Level: ✅✅✅✅⬜ (4/5)
